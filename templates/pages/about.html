        <p>This app is for people who want to practice and improve their English.</p>
        <p>So improve your understanding but also your transcription, your writing, your reading, your syntax, your grammar. It is also the possibility of learning some phrasal verbs placed in a specific context.</p> 
        <p>To have a large amount of content, there are different topics written mainly by the author of the video.<br>
        Most videos are automatically generated based on author-written subtitles and YouTube timestamps.</p>
        <p>Others (not so many) are written by me from YouTube's automatic transcription (and therefore timestamps are also manual).</p>
        <p>Please, feel free to <a href="mailto:contact@dictatube.com">contact me</a> if you would like to make any suggestions.</p>
