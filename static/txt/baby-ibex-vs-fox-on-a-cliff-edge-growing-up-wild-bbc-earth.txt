However, at only a few days' old,
they have to leave their playtime plateaux.
For the first time, 
they must attempt to climb down these terrifying precipices to find food.
It's a daunting prospect,
certainly not for the faint-hearted.
Their mother leads the way.
The kids are understandably tentative.
They must slowly pick their way down the sheer rock faces.
Their mother shows them the best route.
She has done it hundreds of times before.
But for the kids, this is new territory.
Gradually, they start to get the hang of it,
but they need to focus as one slip
could be their last.
Finally, they've made it.
There's a whole new world at the lower levels,
with plenty of food and water.
Here, the parents show off their balancing skills
as they all browse together.
But one kid has been left behind
and she's in trouble.
A fox - and it's spotted the straggler.
The young ibex runs as fast as it can back up the cliff,
but the fox is right on its heels.
It'll be hoping for a quick kill.
As the kid heads back up the cliff,
the fox tries to gain the higher ground.
But the kid has scrambled onto a rock face.
It's so steep that only it could possibly stand there without toppling off.
The fox has no choice but to give up.
It doesn't stand a chance on this precipice.
