2 years ago before the work this was a barren wasteland!
Nothing had been grown here for 40 years
when the UN world food program told the villagers that they were going to bring this land back 
as part of the Great green wall they said it was impossible.
But here we are in Africa, in the desert, at the northern edge of Senegal, and life has returned. 
And the stakes couldn't be higher because when the soil washes away and land becomes a desert
then people leave, they head to the cities and places like this just fall apart.
But thanks to the work of the villagers and the world food program
using techniques and systems that I'm going to tell you about in this video.
The Tides have changed and natural wealth is growing back and growing the livelihoods of the people here.
Welcome to Senegal, I'm here during the rainy season to see the work of the great green wall of Africa.
My wife and I we started in Dakar, a city of about 4 million people. It's the biggest city in Senegal.
It is the Western most point of the entire continent of Africa.
I met with the world food program there in Dakar to discuss our trip,
so then we drove with the world food program it was about a 7our drive through the Sahel
the ecosystem really changed a lot.
In the southern part the trees were larger dispersed amongst the millet Fields.
As we drove North the trees became smaller and smaller, this is late in the rainy season.
This land is as green as it gets right now for the whole year.
I've never seen this many grazing animals, the entire Sahel is like one big free range pasture. 
So we drove up to the point where it transitions to the Sahara Desert which is the Senegal River.
we are here at the Senegal river which is the border between Senegal and this side Mauritania on the other.
When you look from space you can actually see the lateral sand dunes of Mauritania,
where they hit the Senegal river the Senegal river is really the Divide between the Sahara and Sahel in many parts of the river.
So the Senegal River here it serves not only as the border between Senegal and Mauritania and not only as the border between the Sahel and the Sahara.
But if this River zone is vegetated it could represent the first line of defense of the great green wall of Africa.
The great green wall of Africa
Great Green Wall of Africa
is a vision the project to plant a
barrier of trees across the entire width
of the continent of Africa from senagal
to jouti and the purpose of this great
green wall is to stop stop the southern
expansion of the Sahara Desert the
Sahara Desert has expanded about 10% in
the last 100 years so we have the Sahara
Desert then we have the Sahel then we
have the Savannah and then we have the
rainforest the design is to actually
have a barrier of trees to stop the
expansion of the desert Southward so I'm
here on the ground at the great green
wall to show how we can restore degraded
Landscapes we can keep the Sahara at Bay
create abundance have people living here
and
WFP Project
thriving we are here at wfp project site
we are in a very degraded land area in
the early beginning when we presented
the process and the idea the community
didn't believe they said no this is not
true this is not feasible we cannot
recover this land more than 40 years we
are here nothing is growing on this side
the process started with the community
based participatory Planning by the end
of this process it was agreed that one
of the major action in the land
reclamation or land recovery project
this is a sort of school they come to
learn how to imp prove learn the people
believe and they are convinced and they
are also committed you can
see at wfp we have planted and
Great Green Wall
rehabilitated some 300,000 hectar of
land over the past years and what you
see here is 30 hectars out of those
300,000 this is a contribution to the
great green wall because the great green
wall is like a patchwork a mosaic of
forests that together create this wall
that will protect the Sahel from being
encroached by the Sahara Desert we are
working on degraded land and bringing it
back to life and that takes a few stages
when we start with a soil like this one
that we see right here okay that is
crusted that is sunbaked uh that is that
cannot support any kind of life because
it is literally hard as cement there's
no way seed or any plants can actually
take root here we bring it back to life
and we bring it back to production so
that it can feed people and it can feed
the communities and communities can
start thriving
again wa
wait we need to create water harvesting
structures that maintain the water on
site if we look at the soil the way it
is right now the water cannot stay here
so it drains and it flows away so these
half Moons they are the first step in
this Rehabilitation process in this soil
buildup process on this side here we
have 7,500 half Moons Each of which has
a 4 M diameter this takes one person to
dig one half moon per day this site has
been dug by a team of 150 people so how
does the half moon work the rain
basically comes here and we have put the
half Moons on contour lines which means
the rain when it falls to the ground it
flows into this area here which is a
little bit lower so that it retains the
water and we create this embankment okay
that's a little bit higher up and make
sure that the water doesn't overflow
okay and it stays here and it feeds
these plants so we are mainly using
local local species like the Sorghum and
the Millet that actually has been
domesticated here many thousands of
years ago so it actually comes from the
Sahel and produce a maximum quantity of
biomass as well so they are perfect to
rehabilitate the land while feeding the
people at the same time this is nothing
new we have not invented a technology
here the half moon technology is
actually an endogenous technology to the
Sahel and has been forgotten over time
we have rescued it from the
past so the serum that you can see
behind us actually grew only with rain
water around 10 to 15% of water that
will be caught here will enter the
ground and will recharge the groundwater
tables that way we actually achieve a
balance of water so we are not depleting
the Water Resources but we're making
sure that we keep enough water in the
ground for future Generations then we
have another system that mainly consists
of planting lines we have horiculture
beds where we can plant tomatoes okra
and so on here we have trenches where we
have planted Moringa we have planted
pigeon pea and we have planted also some
some okra that has has grown wildly here
and the idea here is that we have
biomass trenches that will provide
biomass us as the system grows in
between these trenches we have planting
pits where we have planted fruit trees
we have guava Citrus this is just a very
first step in this pilot we'll also be
using other native species that will be
planting in the pits that will drive the
Rejuvenation of the soil and the
protection of the soil as the system
starts growing into abundance and
producing food and life for the people
here in its mature State this system
will look like a forest okay Forest
lines that will be producing biomass and
fruit and we'll have other lines in
between where we'll be producing
horiculture vegetables this is exactly
the way nature works we came across
Copic farming which is a type of
conservation agriculture that has been
developed in Brazil based on global
indigenous knowledge in the whole world
many indigenous populations have a
similar way traditionally to do
agriculture that is different from
conventional Agriculture and which
mimics Forest Dynamics in The Next Step
we'll be growing trees here so if we
look at the vastness of this area here
we can plant 10 thousands of trees into
these
[Music]
Villages
structures sometime you come in The
Villages you don't see nobody you can
just see some animals to say okay I
think people are here usually every year
after the rainy season most of the young
people migrate to Dak and other big town
in Sagal this is the internal or the
local migration some leave Sagal to go
to Spain what they are going to do the
agriculture that they leave behind they
go to harvest Apple there why they leave
the same activity
here before they were thinking about how
to
migrate but they Tau me now they don't
think about that with this B Hall we put
in place now we are going to work 12
month on vegetable production now these
young boys who are very key for the
village security for the Village
Development now don't need to go to
leave just old people in the village now
will contribute to the local Dynamic of
the community now they are together they
have social
[Music]
cohesion now this project was really
really interesting cuz the world food
program wanted to demonstrate how you
could take the most devastated areas and
turn them back into resilient food
producing locations and they
specifically plac their project on a
very degraded landscape that had been
taken down to Bare compacted Earth this
is actually the front line of the great
green wall of Africa the Sagal River at
least for this region that's where
you're going to have your real true
dividing line between the Sahara and the
Sahel so the work of the wfp is solving
this problem directly here on the ground
with the great green wall of Africa
