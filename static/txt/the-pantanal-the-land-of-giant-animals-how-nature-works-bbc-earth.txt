Vital ingredients for all life on earth
begin in these raging torrents.
Millions of gallons of water
relentlessly carve through rock and soil,
grinding away,
picking up a precious cargo
sediment
and oxygen.
Together, these are potent ingredients
in these fast flowing waters.
Just a few specially adapted creatures
can survive.
But when the raging torrent slows down
this cargo fuels a transformation.
Nowhere shows this more dramatically
than here in South America.
Water from the Brazilian
plateau floods into a vast lowland bowl
the size of California
to create the greatest wetland on earth.
The Pantanal.
This is home
to the largest cat in the Americas,
the Pantanal Jaguar.
Weighing in at over 160 kilograms,
twice as heavy as an average man.
These famously elusive cats
are so numerous here that people travel from around the world just to see them.
But other predators also
thrive in this wetland.
The biggest snake in the world,
the green anaconda.
It can grow up to nine meters long
and around every corner lurks a caiman,
10 million caimans.
The largest concentration of crocodilians
anywhere on earth.
And all these deadly predators
hunt the largest rodent in the world.
The capybara
100 times heavier than a guinea pig.
The capybara is the dominant plant
eater in the Pantanal.
They gather in huge numbers.
Everything here is big.
This is the land of the giants.
